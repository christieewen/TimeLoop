TimeLoop
========

A crack at implementing the Time loop logic. Excerpt from Wikipedia

A program exploiting time loop logic can be quite simple in outline. For example, to compute one prime factor of the natural number N in polynomial time (no polynomial time factorization algorithm is known in traditional complexity theory; see integer factorization):

If N is 0 or 1, abort. Allocate a communication channel c. Receive one prime factor, F, of N from the future on channel c. Test that F â‰  N, that F divides N (time complexity O(log N)), and that F is prime (polynomial time; see AKS primality test). If so, send F backwards in time on channel c. If not, send F + 1 backwards in time on channel c. Note that this results in a paradox, as the number received in step 3 above is not the same as that sent in this step. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#Time_loop_logic
